<p class="p2"> Creating enough text can be easy or hard. I don't know what you did, Fry, but once again, you screwed up! Now all the planets are gonna start cracking wise about our mamas. Yep, I remember. They came in last at the Olympics, then retired to promote alcoholic beverages! Do a flip!</p>
<p class="p2">Oh, all right, I am. But if anything happens to me, tell them I died robbing some old man. Does anybody else feel jealous and aroused and worried? When will that be? Kids don't turn rotten just from watching TV. That's a popular name today. Little "e", big "B"?</p>
<p class="p2">You'll have all the Slurm you can drink when you're partying with Slurms McKenzie! Ah, the 'Breakfast Club' soundtrack!  I can't wait til I'm old enough to feel ways about stuff! Check it out, y'all. Everyone who was invited is here. You wouldn't. Ask anyway!</p>
